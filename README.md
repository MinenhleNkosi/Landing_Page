# foundations-landing-page
My Foundations Landing Page Project.

1/6/2022 - last commit and completed this project!  I started this project on 1/1/2022.  I have learned a ton about how to use HTML, CSS, and flexbox in particular, to make pages look great and be responsive.  I am happy with the end results of this made up company landing page!  I look forward to moving into JavaScript next and adding that functionality to new projects when the time comes.
